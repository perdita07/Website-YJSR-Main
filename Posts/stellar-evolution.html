                        </div>
                        <p>A star is essentially an astronomical object that is capable of emitting its own light i.e it is self-luminous, unlike planets.</p>
                        <p>This light is produced by a process called nuclear fusion, where hydrogen nuclei in the star’s core fuse together to form a helium nucleus releasing some energy in the process – which we see as light.</p> 
                        <p>This stage where the star emits heat and light via nuclear fusion is called the ‘main sequence’.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">How do stars form?</h2>
                        <p>Now that we know what a star is, let’s look at how they form. A star is in simple terms, a large ball of hydrogen.</p>
                        <p>Stars are formed from the gravitational collapse of dense clouds of gas and dust, often called nebulae or molecular clouds.</p>
                        <p>As this collapse takes place, the cloud fragments into smaller regions which contract with the centres of condensation forming the cores of the stars.</p>
                        <div>
                            <img class="illus-img" src="https://deepthyajithk.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/image-15.png?resize=334%2C334">
                            <p class="img-cap">Source: <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_1444.html">Cepheus B, a molecular cloud located in our Milky Galaxy about 2,400 light years from the Earth, provides an excellent model to determine how stars are formed. This composite image of Cepheus B combines data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Spitzer Space Telescope.

                        </div>
                      <p>As quick as it sounds, this process actually takes millions of years! But then again, in galactic terms, a few million years isn’t that long.</p>
                      <p>The matter that is left over after the star’s formation forms into a disk around the equator of the rotating star.</p>
                      <p>It may also end up being used in the formation of planets or other objects that orbit the star in the disk. </p>
                      <p>These are called planetesimals and their formation takes longer than that of the star.</p>
                      <p>These planetesimals eventually attract more of the debris remaining in the disk and end up contracting further into a spherical shape under their own gravity.</p>
                      <p>Gradually, they form a system of planets, like those in our solar system.</p>

                      </div>
                      <p>Coming to the subject of this article, stellar evolution is in short, the process by which a star changes over a period of time.</p>
                      <p>The primary factor determining how a star evolves is its mass as it reaches the main sequence.</p>
                      <p>A star’s lifetime can range from a few million to a few trillion years depending on its mass with more massive stars having a shorter lifetime.</p>
                      <p>This is because more massive stars use up their fuel quickly thus decreasing their lifetime. </p>
                      <p>As this process takes so long, it is not possible to learn about it from one single star.</p>
                      <p>This also makes sense why stars do not appear to change at all on human timescales.</p>
                      <p>So it is studied by observing numerous stars at various points in their lifetime, and by simulating stellar structure using computer models.</p>
                      <h3>1.Birth-Protostar</h3>
                      <p>As mentioned before, the birth of a star and its evolution starts with the gravitational collapse of a cool, dense molecular cloud.</p>
                      <p> It breaks into smaller and smaller fragments in which the collapsing gas releases gravitational potential energy as heat. </p>
                      <p>The subsequent increase in temperature and pressure result in the fragment’s condensation into a rotating ball of superhot gas known as a protostar.</p>
                      <p>Or to put it simply,  a star that’s still gathering mass from its parent molecular cloud is called a protostar.</p>
                      <div>

                      </div>
                      <h3>2.Main Sequence</h3>
                      <p>As defined earlier, a main-sequence star is that which makes use of nuclear fusion at its core to emit heat and light.</p>
                      <p>For about 90% of its lifetime, this process takes place and these stars on the main sequence are called dwarf stars. </p>
                      <p>The onset of nuclear fusion leads to their cores being at hydrostatic equilibrium. </p>
                      <p>This is when the energy released by the core by maintaining a high gas pressure balances the weight of the star’s matter thereby preventing further gravitational collapse.</p>
                      <p>The star thus evolves rapidly to a stable state, beginning the main-sequence phase of its evolution.</p>
                      <p>The star’s core eventually exhausts its hydrogen supply paving the path for next stages of its evolution, off the main sequence.</p>
                      <div>
                        <img class="illus-img" src="https://i0.wp.com/deepthyajithk.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/image-10.png?ssl=1">

                      </div>
                      <h4>2a.Low mass stars</h4>
                      <p>Stars whose mass is less than half the Sun’s mass are called low-mass stars.</p>
                      <p>They may be orange, red or brown and are the coolest main sequence stars, besides being the smallest as well.</p>
                      <p>As their mass is comparatively less, they have long lives as they consume their hydrogen fuel slowly.</p>
                      <p>On running out of fuel, they turn into white dwarves which in turn, cools and contracts further to give black dwarves.</p>
                      <h4>2b.High mass stars</h4>
                      <p>Stars whose mass is greater than three times that of the Sun’s mass are called high mass stars.</p>
                      <p>Contrary to low-mass stars, these are the hottest and largest main sequence stars.</p>
                      <p>They may be blue or white in colour. In lieu of what we earlier said about the correlation between mass and lifespan, high mass stars have short lives as they consume their fuel quickly.</p>

                      <h3>3.Old age - Red Giants and Supergiants</h3>
                      <p>A red giant is essentially a dying star in the later stages of stellar evolution.</p>
                      <p>Its mass is roughly between 0.3 and 8 solar masses. In fact, our own Sun is slated to become one in the next 5 billion years. </p>
                      <p>Once the nuclear fusion taking place at the core ceases, the hydrostatic equilibrium is lost and the forces of gravity begin compressing the star. </p>
                      <p>This compression in turn causes an increase in both, temperature and energy generation resulting in the star expanding and growing brighter.</p>
                      <div>
                        <img class="illus-img" src="https://i0.wp.com/deepthyajithk.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/image-17.png?ssl=1">

                      </div>
                      <p>Their diameters can range anywhere from 100 million to 1 billion kilometres and this would cause their energy to be distributed across a large area.</p>
                      <p>This causes their surface temperatures to be relatively cool, reaching only 4,000 to 5,800 degrees Fahrenheit (2,200 to 3,200 degrees Celsius). </p>
                      <p>This temperature change causes stars to shine in the redder part of the spectrum, leading to the name “red giant”.</p>
                      <p>Supergiants are in short, massive giant stars.</p>
                      <p>They are among the largest and brightest stars known with their mass ranging from 8 -12 solar masses and luminosities varying between a thousand to a million times that of the sun.</p>
                      <p>As expected, their lifespan is also the shortest.</p>
                      <h4>What happens when a star runs out of fuel?</h4>
                      <p>A star is said to ‘die’ when it runs out of fuel.</p>
                      <p>And without nuclear fusion to maintain the hydrostatic equilibrium, the forces of gravity cause it to collapse under its own weight.</p>
                      <p>Following complete consumption of its fuel, what’s left of a star i.e its remnants either become a white or black dwarf, neutron star or a black hole, depending on the mass during its lifetime.</p>
                      <p>This brings us to the final stage of stellar evolution.</p>
                      <h3>4. Death and Remnants</h3>
                      <h4>White dwarves and planetary nebula</h4>
                      <p>White dwarfs are considered the final evolutionary state of stars whose mass is not high enough for them to end up as a neutron star or a black hole.</p>
                      <p>Red giants eventually become incredibly compact, turning into a superdense object known as a white dwarf while the upper layers will expand and eject material that will collect around the dying star to form a planetary nebula.</p>

                      <p>A planetary nebula is seen when a red giant dies. Contrary to their name, they have nothing to do with planets.</p> 
                      <p>When red giants die,  they expel gas and their cores contract to start radiating energy.</p>
                      <p>This energy ionises the expelled gas, causing the atoms in it to emit light.</p>
                      <p>Thus, a planetary nebula is an emission nebula that is comprised of an expanding, glowing shell of ionized gas ejected by dying red giants.</p>

                      <p>After the white dwarf has expelled or fused all the possible elements, a dense sphere of electron degenerate matter is left which on cooling by thermal radiation gives birth to a black dwarf.</p>
                      <p>What sets black dwarves apart from everything discussed here is that they’re still theoretical i.e we’ve never been able to observe one.</p>
                      <p>This is because the time required for a white dwarf to reach this state is calculated to be longer than the current age of the universe which is considered to be 13.77 billion years.</p>
                      <h4>Supernova</h4>
                      <p>A supernova is simply a massive stellar explosion.</p>
                      <p>This can happen in several scenarios – either when high-mass stars that have passed through a red supergiant stage die in supernovae explosions or when a white dwarf is triggered into runaway nuclear fusion.</p>
                      <p>These explosions are important and rare.</p>
                      <p>Supernovae release these elements i.e elements heavier than hydrogen and helium that have been produced at some point in a star’s life into space making them available to be incorporated within later generations of stars.</p>

Chinese astronomers witnessed the event in 185 A.D., documenting a mysterious “guest star” that remained in the sky for eight months. X-ray images from NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and the European Space Agency’s XMM-Newton Observatory were combined to form the blue and green colors in the image.

                      <h4>Neutron stars and black holes</h4>
                      <p>Known to be the smallest and densest class of stellar objects, neutron stars are formed as a result of the supernova explosion of a massive star combined with the gravitational collapse that causes the neutron star’s core to be as dense as that of an atomic nucleus.</p>
                      <p>In short, a neutron star is the collapsed core of a massive star whose mass may range between 10 and 25 solar masses.</p>
                      <p> As the name suggests, a neutron star is a star composed almost entirely of neutrons about 10 to 20 kilometres in diameter.</p>
                      <p>Remnant stellar cores may also form pulsars which are rapidly rotating neutron stars or black holes which are objects with a gravitational attraction so strong that not even light can escape.</p>
